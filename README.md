## Instagram Automation

This is a script that I made for my personal use to stop endless doomscrolling and brainrotting.

It heavily relies on instagrapi package. 

It is still not tested, but ideally it should be triggered by a chron job to do the following:

- Check if there are stories uploaded by accounts listed in `targets.txt` , and if there are, send an email notification so that the stories can be checked on demand.
